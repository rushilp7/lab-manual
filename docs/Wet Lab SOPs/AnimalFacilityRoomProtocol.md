Our mice are housed in John Morgan (JM3) - Room 363

## 1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Requirements

Before entering Room 363, ensure you are wearing:
* Sterile gloves

If you are opening cages, you will also need to wear:
* Shoe covers
* Isolation gown
* Face mask
* Scrub cap (optional)

Remove all PPE before leaving the animal facility room.

### 2. Biosafety Cabinet Protocol

Always use the biosafety cabinet when opening cages to handle mice.

#### Before Use:
Turn on the light and fan.

#### During Use:
The alarm will ring once in a while. Press the alarm button to turn it off. 

#### After Use:
Wipe down the surface with disinfectant.
Turn off the light and fan.

### 3. Transporting Mice to the Lab

#### Survival Surgery:
* Use new, clean cages for transportation.
* Cover the cage with an isolation gown during transport.
* Flip the water bottle upside down to prevent flooding the cage during transport.
* If transporting many cages at once, use a cart from the lab. 

#### Terminal Surgery:
* Use food pails for transportation. 
* Maximum 2-3 mice per food pail.

#### General Guidelines:
* Discard cages in the wash station when no longer needed.
* Deactivate cage cards once a cage is no longer in use.

### 4. Breeding and Weaning Mice

#### Identification and Numbering:
* ID numbers > 1000 typically denote breeders.
* ID numbers < 1000 usually denote pups.

#### Breeder Cages:
* Denote breeder cages by boxing the cage ID (e.g. C001).
* Breeders should be replaced every 6-8 months. Remaining pups are sacrificed as necessary.

#### Pregnancy and Weaning Procedures:
* If a female becomes pregnant, move other mice out of the cage. Return the removed mice to the cage once the pups have been weaned.
* Order cage cards to be activated on the weaning date. Cage card requests should be submitted through POLARIS at least 2 business days in advance. 
* Wean pups after 21 days and ear-tag them for identification. Remember to update the colony sheet: [Cheng Lab Colony Sheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nWXFYK2RldgJ07-j5yEXCYFKmiCouoic/edit?gid=868474274#gid=868474274) 
*If you do not know which female is the mom, leave both females in the cage. The pups will die if the mom is removed. 
*Check on colony regularly in order to keep track of new pups. 

### Post-Weaning Procedures:
* Label cage cards with breeder cage ID, mouse IDs, and gender.
* Separate pups by gender. 
* Each cage can have a maximum of 5 mice. 
* Different litters with the same genotype can be housed together. 
* Ensure that the lab maintains no more than ~20 cages. 

### 5. Experimental Use of Mice

* Mice are used for experiments between the ages of 6-8 weeks.
* Refer to the colony sheet (Cheng Lab Colony Sheet) to select mice of the appropriate age and/or genotype. 
* Mark these mice by writing the experiment name under the “Notes” column.
* Make sure the colony sheet is up-to-date by inputting the IDs of new pups under their respective breeder cages 
* Once taken for experiments, record the mouse ID and cage card ID in the Mice Log Sheet
