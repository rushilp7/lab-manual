To familiarize yourself with the tools of the trade, here are two external resources to cover the necessities:

* BRITE-REU Programming Workshops: [https://programming-workshops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://programming-workshops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
* Foundations in Computational Skills: [https://foundations-in-computational-skills.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://foundations-in-computational-skills.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

The first course was created in 2018 with the intention of shoring up undergraduate student interns' dry lab skills and the other course was designed in 2017 to do the same for incoming candidates for the BU Bioinformatics PhD program.

These will only cover the software side. For information about:

* Our computational resources, see the [HPC wiki](https://hpcwiki.pmacs.upenn.edu/wiki/index.php/HPC:User_Guide).
* Bioinformatics, you should visit our [Bioinformatics](https://yuyanchenglab.github.io/docs/Intro%20to%20Computation/Bioinformatics.html) and then our [Dry Lab SOPs](https://yuyanchenglab.github.io/docs/Dry%20Lab%20SOPs/).
