## Building, Lab and Facility

This is our address:

    422 Curie Blvd
    3rd floor
    Stellar-Chance Laboratories
    Philadelphia, PA 19104

Exiting the elevators, the hallways form a square with office suites at 3 of the corners and a common area & conference room in the other corner. Diagonally across from that common area corner is Dr. Cheng's office in room 309C. Our lab is directly adjacent and is room 310. It is labelled with a sticker that says "The Coolest Laboratory on EARTH".

[comment]: <> (Include a picture of the floor layout here instead of just the description.)

The floor outside of work hours, the building, and the lab each require card access. You should message Dr. Cheng with a photo of your PennCard to grant you this access. If you ever experience a lockout, you may go to security on the first floor of Stellar-Chance for assistance.
