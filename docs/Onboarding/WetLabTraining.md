## Placing and Organizing Orders

Penn Marketplace is the platform used to order all necessary lab supplies. If you would like to order items outside of Marketplace, please speak to Dr. Cheng.

Use the following URL to access Marketplace: [https://procurement.upenn.edu/making-purchases/penn-marketplace](https://procurement.upenn.edu/making-purchases/penn-marketplace)

Please contact Cass or Dr. Cheng to be added to the Order Request List and Order Already Placed Google Sheets.

They can be accessed at the following shared documents:

* Order Request List
* Orders Already Placed

### Organizing Order Requests

Check if the desired item has been ordered previously by searching the various tabs at the bottom of the Order Request List Sheet. You can also use the Find function to search.

If the item is not already featured on the Sheet, open Penn Marketplace and search for the item in the Shop – search bar.

Once you find your item through either the Sheet or Marketplace search, fill out all the information on the Sheet.

* IMPORTANT: Items will be ordered by Joy according to supplier! Add items from the same supplier to the Active Cart, and send the order out by each supplier. You can also open multiple carts by accessing Shop – My Carts – View Carts – Create Cart. To choose which cart your next item will be added to, select the dropdown menu of the cart and click Activate.

To order the item, input the desired quantity and select Add to Cart.

If instead you see Order from Supplier, click that button instead. You will be directed to the supplier’s website.

Change the quantity to your desired value, and check out the cart on the supplier’s website. You will then be directed back to Penn Marketplace, and the item will be in your active cart.

Once you finish your order, click the Assign Cart button. Select Search, and put Yuyan in the first name slot, and Cheng in the last name slot.

Click the + button next to Dr. Cheng’s name. This will assign the cart to Dr. Cheng, who will then approve the order and send it to Joy to complete.

### Organizing Placed Orders

Dr. Cheng will notify you when the order is placed. You will also receive email confirmation from Joy. When that happens, the second Sheet (Orders Already Placed) will need to be updated.

Cut the order from the Orders Requested Sheet, and paste into the first tab of the Orders Already Placed sheet.

Fill out the PO number on the sheet. This value can be found on the order receipt attached to Joy’s confirmation email.

### Receiving Orders

The delivery worker will come to the lab to drop off items. They will ask for a signature, which can be done by any hire.

Open the package and remove the packing slip with the order information. Place the paper(s) in the drawer by the door.

Place the item in its appropriate place, and notify the lab of its arrival in #deliveries on Slack.

If you are unsure of where the item should go, please reach out to Cass, Jeff, or Dr. Cheng.

Large boxes can be disposed of by placing them in the hallway. Make sure they are not obstructing the hallway.
